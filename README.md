# SKO
Calista Ang's SKO :
Throughout this semester, we have learnt to code in 3 coding languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We started by learning the meaning phrases www (World Wide Web) and all 3 of the coding languages. We learned how to setup our GitHub, Visual Studio Code, how to get the extensions, co-pilot, and also processing. We started from making a readme, playing with index.html, changing cursors, rotating texts, sketching up on processing, making our portraits, trying up sounds, up to making our own SKO website. 

We learned a lot of new things, especially code. Though I have had HTML and CSS classes before, I do think that creative coding is a very new learning. I have not thought of making an interactive one before but here we are, making interactive JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It definitely needed a lot of focus since I made plenty of errors just because of forgetting a capital letter, dots and semicolon, which was a bit frustrating but when run successfully does give a big fulfillment.  

I also find the concrete poetry part interesting as it has very little words, even letters, and they are constructed in such different ways. That and the paper prototype was an interesting and fun way to foresee how the major project would be and what we can improve, especially the arcade activity in class, as we can immediately see peopleâ€™s reaction on our prototype and how they interact with it, making sure that our project is easy to understand and effective.  

Nevertheless, this was a very fun and engaging studio, I enjoyed it a lot and I look forward to endeavoring another coding project, maybe try making a portfolio website, an interactive one.
