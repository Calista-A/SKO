        <p class="body-text">The World Wide Web or when shortened WWW, refers to all public websites that can be accessed through the internet, by using devices like laptops and phones. “Hypertext and HTTP are key components of the WWW, which enables users to access web pages by standardizing communications and data transfer between the internet's servers and clients.” (Rahul A, 2023).</p>

        <p class="body-text">“Most web documents and pages are created using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), a text-based way of describing how content within an HTML file is structured. HTML describes the structure of web pages using elements or tags and displays the content of these pages through a web browser.” (Rahul A, 2023).</p>
        <p class="body-text">Basically, to access a page, our device supplies a universal identifier to the web server by using a browser, like chrome. The identifier can be a URL or URI which is unique to each web page, so no doubles!</p>

            <p class="in-class-body-text">We tried coding HTML and CSS in class. We experimented and practiced through the afternoon classes throughout the first half of the semester, ofcourse, also with Javascript, that would be on the next parts.</p>
            <p class="in-class-body-text">On the first picture is the index.HTML. We tried positioning texts, sizing, coloring, custumising it into our cursor, making it a trail, rotating it, spinning, playing with image backgrounds, also sounds.</p>

            <p class="in-class-body-text">On the last picture is the HTML.

            <p class="in-class-body-text">On the first picture, we made a stretchable circle that changes size when we hover our mouse, then make it to changing colours, opacity and a mix of everything, we also experimented ourselves on making the portrait.</p>
            <p class="in-class-body-text">The index.html on the last section was also made in processing, which I mixed with visual studio code to try the javascript features making an image as our cursor like inthis SKO!</p>
            <p class="in-class-body-text"> On the second and last picture, we tried making buttons spawn and radio buttons. We also tried making the buttons change colors and sizes when hovered.</p>
            <p class="in-class-body-text">Another one that we tried was inputing sound to our code, we used the bell sound in different ways, like as background noise, when hovered, when clicked, and when pressed.</p>
            <p class="in-class-body-text">They were all updated every week, where we make changes to the files we did on the other classes, and sometimes, we make new files, depending on the code topic.</p>

            <p class="in-class-body-text">We did some crazy eight activity in class, in the earliest one, we sketched eight concepts on a word that we thought of that immediate moment. I chose the word "inevitable", since that was the word I thought of immediately, remembering someone trying to spell it. We made 8 different concepts of the word in 1 minute each. Then choose oen and tried coding it. Similarly, we also did for concepting our major project, that was the one on the picture. Though, in the end, I ended up changing my concept because of a sudden idea I thought of when daydreaming. The major project ended up to be "The-Wiring", after coming up with a sketch and asking for feedback, I started researching for inspirations.</p>

            <p class="in-class-body-text">As you can see on the picture above, we did some concrete poerty after reading the resources on the modules. We chose a message and turned them into a concrete poetry. I chose "The machine cannot find your memory. Imagination cache has been oblirated. Restroe default dreams? Ok". That was one of the sentences from the OK text which we had to choose from. Then after reading all of the concrete poetries in the modules, I chose some words, deconstruct them, and try make it into concrete poetry.</p>

            <p class="in-class-body-text">This one was a group activity. We did it in a group of four. We decided to choose a racing car game and made a paper prototype of it. We divided parts, some made the cars, some prototyped the background, finish line, and the obstacles. We also made a console prototype of just left and right arrows. This activity was for us to practice making a paper prototype for our first assignment. It is also for us to practice communicating our concepts, designs to client, as paper prototype can be easily edited, and changed. It is a good way to try out our designs, making sure that it works, and is user friendly.</p>

            <p class="in-class-body-text">This was the first paper prototype I made. It was first about a field representing the world and flowers growing representing people when resources are shared. We brought our paper prototype to class right before submiting, to gain feedbacks from peers, and look at the user experience. It was the submitted as the first assignment, though in the end changed.</p>

After reading all of them, I decided to go with Guerilla Open Access Manifesto, because I liked the phrase "Information is power.". It was very relateable and I thought it would be a good concept for my major project.</p>
            <p class="in-class-body-text">We also read the OK text, which was the one we used for the concrete poetry. We also read the other websites, like artist inspirations, and the other readings that were on the modules.</p>

I prompted my questions, added my whole code, then copy and pasted them, and run it. If it does not work, I would then ask for a trouble shoot, or make a different prompt, then add the faulty code. If that still did not work, I then use the original one with least problem, and prompt a different idea. Most of the time, it likes to change my messages and positioning of my images as well as the sizes, so I would edit them my self, but use the functions, or combine them when it is 2 different messages.
