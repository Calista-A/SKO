    <p class="Subheader">Prototype 1 - Flower Prototype</p>
    <div class="video-container">
        <video id="myVideo1" onclick="playVideo('myVideo1')" controls>
            <source src="V1.mp4" type="video/mp4"> <!-- Ensure your video path is correct -->

    </div>
    <p class="body-text">This is the first prototype of my major project. I liked the way it represent the growth of human by sharing knowledge and experience. But I think it was too empty and quite hard to understand. As one of my peers said, "it might be hard to understand for some people, maybe add text for detail on meaning different people can have different understanding of image symbols." and another one gave me a suggestion to add some sentence at the end, or sound and new elements to make it more interesting.". Even so, I felt that it was a bit misconnected to the way people connect and share, as in information is power. I think that it needed more context and something more because it felt incomplete.</p>
    
    <p class="Subheader">Prototype 2 - Bulbs Prototype</p>
    <div class="video-container">
        <video id="myVideo2" onclick="playVideo('myVideo2')" controls>
            <source src="V2.MP4" type="video/mp4"> <!-- Ensure your video path is correct -->

        </video>
        <figcaption style="color: rgb(0, 195, 255); margin-top: 5px;">Click to Play Video</figcaption>
    </div>
    <p class="body-text">This is the second and my final prototype for my project. The idea came very sudden after me wanting to change or alter my flower prototype. I thought of how electricity is power and it needs wire to distribute electricity to bulbs. Which makes a connection to how information needs to be distributed in order for people to use it. I then sketched it out, where there were bulbs and when you hover your mouse the bulbs will turn on, and then asked for feedbacks from my peers and they immediately understood it more than the first one, so I asked Andy, and got a feedback on how people needs to connect with each other to be able to share informations. That was how the prototype became connecting wires and then became "The-Wiring."</p>
